# CORAL
CORAL (Comparison Of Radiative AnaLyses) calculates the optical properties of particulate aerosols for use in atmospheric models. It is designed to compare three different optical scattering theories:

1) Mie scattering - assumes that particles are spherical
2) MMF (Modified Mean Field theory) - calculates the fractal properties of an input file, and uses these to calculate scattering properties
3) DDA (Discrete Dipole Approximation) - uses the exact shape file to determine the scattering properties.

The main outputs are the optical efficiencies $Q_{ext}$, $Q_{sca}$, $Q_{abs}$, and $g=<\cos(\theta)>$, as well as the associated cross-sections in $\mu m^2$, for a given wavelength range, aggregate radius range, shape-type, and refractive index profile.

All three methods and their equations used in the code are explained in detail in the paper within this folder (Lodge_et_al_2023.pdf). We are incredibly grateful to Kouji Adachi, Peter Buseck and Serena Chung 
for allowing the use of the shape.dat files included in the templates folder, which were obtained using the methods outlined in their paper ["Shapes of soot aerosol particles and implications for their 
effects on climate"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2009JD012868) (2010), JGR.

# Running the Code

1) Download all of the files into a directory of your choice -- these are already set up to run as demonstration. There are 6 key files in this folder:

    - CORAL.c (the main code which we will compile)
    - shape.dat (the shape file that describes the aerosol)
    - parameters.txt (sets the parameters for the scattering models)
    - refractive_index_data.txt (describes the wavelength dependence of refractive index)
    - STAG.py (allows users to view the shapes interactively in 3D)
    - Shape Templates (this includes the three shapes used in Lodge et al. (2023))

2) To compile, simply navigate to the directory from within the terminal window, and type: 

         gcc -o CORAL CORAL.c -fopenmp -lm -O3

The flag -fopenmp enables OpenMP and parallel processing, which rapidly speed up the code, and -O3 gives a further increased speed boost. OpenMP is usually necessary 
to enable calculations at a reasonable speed, but users can remove the '#include omp.h' header from within CORAL.c, and remove the '-fopenmp' flag from above if they 
do not want to use it. Further details about OpenMP are [here.](https://www.openmp.org/)

3) To run the code, simply type:

       ./CORAL

# Parameters file

The parameters file details the range of wavelengths to study and the size of the particles etc. There are several options for the user to choose, and these are detailed below.

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: the formatting has to be kept <i>exactly</i> the same as the original file i.e. if you change "shapeswitch= 1" to "shapeswitch=1" (if you delete the space after the equals sign), the code will not work. </b>

    shapeswitch: set this to 1 to use shape data file as an input, or set to 0 to make our own spheres with requested N (see below)
    marbleswitch: set to 1 to use Biconjugate Method with Stabilisation method of solving linear equations, or 0 to use standard conjugate gradient method. In our experience, the latter is faster.
    accuracy: this sets the accuracy required for three consecutive iterations of the equation solver to agree and determine that they have converged. We recommend a value of 0.00001, representing (0.001% agreement) 
    aerosol_radius_min: set the minimum radius of aerosols to be examined, in um
    aerosol_radius_max= set the maximum radius of aerosols to be examined, in um
    n_radii: sets the number of radii to be analysed within the range above (max-min)
    radius_increment_type: set equal to 0 for linear-spaced incrememnts, or 1 for log-spaced increments
    requested_N: chooses a rough number of dipoles to create pseudospheres out of, if making our own spheres using shapeswitch=0 (rather than an input file)
    speed_test: Set to 0 to ignore, or set to 1 to record the times that various parts in the code reach. Used for debugging/speed benchmrking.
    
    /* wavelength range */
    wavelength_min: the minimum wavelength of radiation to be examined, in um
    wavelength_max: the maximum wavelength of radiation to be examined, in um
    num_wavelengths: sets the number of wavelengths to be analysed within the range above (max-min)
    wavelength_increment_type= 1  set equal to 0 for linear-spaced incrememnts, or 1 for log-spaced increments
    
    /* resolution that determines the number of angles that will be used */
    orientational_average_resolution: determines how many angles to fire incoming radiation from (see copy of Fig. C1 in Lodge_et_al_2023.pdf). For example, a value of 0 corresponds to 12 equally-spaced angles, a value of 1 corresponds to 42 angles, a value of 2 corresponds to 92 angles and so on... 
    
    threadnumber: choose the number of threads to distribute the parallelised calculations across
    
    N_monomers: set the number of monomers for the shape that you are analysing (often you can judge this by eye using STAG)
    MMF_method: select the cut-off function for the structure factor calculation a value of 0 gives a gaussian cutoff and a value of 1 gives a fractal cutoff. We use the fractal cutoff as default to match OPTOOL. For more details, see Eq. (19) of Tazaki, R. and Tanaka, H., 2018. Light scattering by fractal dust aggregates. II. opacity and asymmetry parameter. The Astrophysical Journal, 860(1), p.79.

Fig C1 from Lodge et al. (2023), with example angles for incoming radiation marked:

  - "orientational_average_resolution= 0" would assess 12 angles
  - "orientational_average_resolution= 1" would assess 42 angles
  - "orientational_average_resolution= 2" would assess 92 angles
  - "orientational_average_resolution= 5" would assess 362 angles, etc.

# Shape templates

<b>IMPORTANT NOTE: When changing shape files, remember to state how many monomers the aggregate is composed of as the 'N_monomers' variable in "parameters.txt".</b>

Three demonstration shape files used in Lodge et al. (2023) are included, but any DDSCAT-style shape file will work.

   - compact cluster (N_monomers = 21)
   - linear branched fractal (N_monomers = 76)
   - elongated cluster (N_monomers = 15)

These three shapes are shown (in order, left to right) below. For more detail about how N_monomers is determined, please read section 3.3 of Lodge et al. (2023).

# STAG

To view your 3D model in STAG (assuming that python is intalled on your device), simply type the following into the terminal:

    python STAG.py

This should produce a rotatable interactive figure, similar to the shapes shown above.

# Output files

If left at the default settings, CORAL will now calculate scattering properties for IR radiation of wavelength 1.5um incident on a linear branched fractal of radius 0.5 um, 
calculated over an average of 12 different directions and two perpendicular polarisation states. Several output files will appear:

MAIN OUTPUTS: 

Each of the following files finds $Q_{ext}$, $Q_{sca}$, $Q_{abs}$, and $g=<\cos(\theta)>$, as well as the associated cross-sections in $\mu m^2$, for each of the Mie, MMF and DDA models, at each particle radius and wavelength.

   - mie_results.txt
   - mmf_results.txt
   - DDA_results.txt

OTHER FILES:

The other files may be of use to those that wish to do further detailed analysis.

   - angles.txt (the list of incident angles that the EM radiation came from, in spherical polar coordinates defined by ISO 80000-2:2019)
   - ddscat_shape.dat (creates a DDSCAT-type shape.dat file in the case that the user chooses to create pseudosphere (see 'shapeswitch' in parameter file)
   - dipole_coords.txt (creates a list of coordinates for STAG.py to read and display the shape in 3D)
   - LDR_criteria.txt (ignore this)
   - MMF_key_parameters.txt (outputs fractal parameters $d_f$, $k_0$, $N$ and $R_g$ for a given shape type for single-wavelength and particle size calculations).
   - qtable.txt (lists results in exactly the same format as DDSCAT for easier comparison)
   - refractive_index_data.refrind (outputs the refractive index in the format required by VIRGA for further calculations - see folder of the same name below)
   - results_angle_averages_y.txt (angle averages of the optical properties for each wavelength assessed, y-polarisation (0,1,0) only)
   - results_angle_averages_z.txt (angle averages of the optical properties for each wavelength assessed, z-polarisation (0,0,1) only)
   - results_angles_y.txt (optical properties for every angle for each wavelength assessed, y-polarisation (0,1,0) only)
   - results_angles_z.txt (optical properties for every angle for each wavelength assessed, z-polarisation (0,0,1) only)
   - VIRGA (outputs optical properties for all three models in the format required by VIRGA for further calculations/use in cloud models; see [VIRGA](https://github.com/natashabatalha/virga) for more details.
